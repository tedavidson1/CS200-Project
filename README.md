# CS200-Project
This project was a team effort for an entire semester. The first 3 phases of the project were making UML diagrams of how the software would work.

I am responsible for all of the diagrams relating to reports being created, as well as the class diagram, which was designed by another team member and myself.

For the last part of the project, we had to actually implement our design using Java. The classes I wrote are: Timer, Member, Provider, Account, and Report Creator.

Throughout the project, my team ranked me as the person who contributed the most to the project.
I coordinated the team to have certain elements completed by certain dates, meet together in Zoom calls, as well as provide any assistance to a team member who needed it. I also actively tested the software as we made it, pointing out bugs and issues that needed to be solved by the writer of that class.

Bitbucket was the platform used for version control.
